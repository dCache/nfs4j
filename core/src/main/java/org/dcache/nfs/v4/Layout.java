/**
 * A Layout defines how a file's data is organized on one or more storage devices. There are three layout types are
 * defined in rfc 5661: <pre>
 *    NFSV4.1 FILE (rfc 5661)
 *    BLOCK VOLUME (rfc 5663)
 *    ODS OBJECT (rfc 5664)
 * </pre>
 *
 * A Layout is expressed as an array of layout segments. The elements of the array MUST be sorted in ascending order of
 * the value of the offset field of each element.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   segment1: offset 0, len 256K
 *   segment2: offset 256, len 256K
 *   ....
 *   segmentN: offset M, len 256K
 * </pre>
 *
 * There MUST be no gaps or overlaps in the range between two successive elements.
 *
 * There are a two ways to stripe a file: across different devices or/and across multiple data servers defined as a
 * single device. Striping within a single device is the one which supported by all clients (as of kernel 2.6.34 linux
 * client does not support multiple layout segments and uses the first entry one only).
